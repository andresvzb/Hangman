 *                   The program also has 2 files: words.txt and gamelog.txt
 *                  one holds the words and the other is to keep track of the
 *                  secret word and the number of guesses
 * Semester:         COP2250 Spring 2016

 * Lab Section:      Lab 1 (Mondays)
 * Description of Pgm: Asking the user if he/she wants to play Hangman
 *                      Diplaying the blanks for the user to guess
 *                      Display the number of guesses the user has left
 *                      If the user win display appropiate message, if the
 *                      user loses display appropiate message
 *                      Ask if the user wants to play again
 *                  As extra credit the program also reads the words from the file
 *              words.txt and writes some output to the file gamelog.txt

        //    You have x-number of guesses before you lose.  (x-number is calculated as the number of letters in the word times 3).

        //     3.  Ask the user:  What is your next letter guess? (enter 1 letter only)
        //     4.  Check if the letter exists in the secret word (hint:  use the String method indexOf(String str, int fromIndex) ).  
        //         a.)  For every location where the letter was found in the word, put the letter in place of the underscore.  
        //         b.)  Each time the user enters a letter, subtract 1 from the total number of guesses left.  
        //         c.)  Keep displaying the same prompt as before, with the updates of the letters in the secret word and the count of guesses decrementing. 
        //              The number of guesses is equal to the number of letters in the secret word multiplied by 3.

        //              What is your letter guess? (enter 1 letter only)
